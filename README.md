# HR-Dashboard-project

 ## Project Overview
 I designed an HR Dashboard using SQL, Power BI, and Excel to visualize workforce metrics for an organization. This dashboard helps HR professionals and stakeholders gain actionable insights into employee distribution, gender ratio, racial diversity, departmental workforce, and trends over time

 ## Objective
 The primary goal of this project was to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard to help HR teams analyze employee data efficiently. Key metrics include:

Total number of employees.

Gender ratio and race distribution.

Department-wise workforce distribution.

Workforce trends over time.

Location-based employee statistics (Headquarters vs. Remote).

## Tools Used
SQL: For querying, cleaning, and preprocessing the data.

Excel: For initial data cleaning and formatting before importing to Power BI.

Power BI: For designing the visual dashboard and connecting dynamic data models.

## Steps Involved

Data Import and Cleaning

I began with a dataset containing employee records (HR Data.csv).
The data was cleaned using Excel, where missing values and inconsistencies were handled. Basic transformations included renaming columns, removing duplicates, and ensuring correct formats.

Data Modeling in SQL

Using SQL, I processed the cleaned data, including:
Filtering relevant columns (e.g., gender, department, race, year of employment).
Aggregating metrics (e.g., calculating employee counts by department, location, etc.).
Creating derived fields for trend analysis and visualization.

Dashboard Design in Power BI

I imported the processed data into Power BI and built interactive visualizations, such as:
A card to display the total number of employees.
Bar charts for employee distribution across departments and racial diversity.
A pie chart for the gender ratio.
A line chart to show workforce trends over time.
A doughnut chart for location-based employee distribution.

## Key Insights
The dashboard highlights key insights:

A majority of employees work in engineering (6.7K).

Gender distribution leans slightly male (50.81% male, 46.46% female, and 2.72% non-conforming).

Most employees work at the headquarters (75.25%).

Racial diversity varies significantly across departments, with detailed visualizations provided.
